- Happy coding! :D

## Steps to use Graph Visualisation:

- import drawGraph.js and edge.js in the head of your HTML file as follows:  
`<script src="Your/Path/GraphLibrary/drawGraph.js"></script>`  
`<script src="Your/Path/GraphLibrary/edge.js"></script>`  

- Call functions in the body of your HTML file as follows:  
`<script>`  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `drawGraphNodes();`      
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `makeCanvas();`    
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `drawUnDirEdge();`      
`</script>`
